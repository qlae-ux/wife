  <p>
    This is not a grand confession.
    It’s not polished, not confident,
    not perfectly spoken.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s the kind of love
    that lives in pauses,
    in unfinished sentences,
    in moments where I wanted to speak
    but chose silence instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    I never knew how to say it properly.
    Every time I tried,
    the words felt smaller than the feeling.
  </p>

  <p>
    So this is me trying differently.
    Not louder.
    but i know to myself 
    iloveyou.
