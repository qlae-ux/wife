## Project: Somehow We Became Friends

### Description
I just wanted to document something real.

### Background
Hi dar,

I just wanted to say thank you—because you became my friend.
I don’t know when it started.
I don’t know where it happened.
I don’t know how it even worked.

One day you were just… there.
No pull request.
No merge conflict.
No official agreement.
It just suddenly happened. LMAO.

### Current State
And honestly? I’m really glad it did.

Somewhere along the way, you became part of my journey.
Part of my random thoughts.
Part of the moments that didn’t feel as boring anymore.

### Notes
I appreciate the conversations.
The randomness.
The laughs that came out of nowhere.
The comfort of knowing you’re around.

### Final Comment
This isn’t a big dramatic message.
Just a simple acknowledgment:

Meeting you was a good thing.
And I’m thankful for that.
